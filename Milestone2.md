# Milestone 2:

## 3 Goals Status
Our application has not fully accomplished any of our three goals. However, we have a solid start on goal 2: as of right now, we have a basic login system which will allow users to login and see a list of teams that they follow. But, we have not set up the user interface so that they can make accounts, edit their profiles, follow teams, etc.

## 7 Requirements Status
Our application fulfills requirement 3, having users. We have not fulfilled any other requirements so far. 

## Models and Controllers
We have set up a Users table, Sports table, Teams table, and User_Teams table. There is a one to many relationship between Sports and Teams, and a many to many relationship between users and teams. 

## Direction
As of right now, we are not deviating from the original plan. I believe we would need to develop a bit more to see if our plans needed to change. 

## React Components
We plan to build 4 main pages. The first will be a description of our website with buttons to login and signup. The second will be our login/signup page. The third will be a page with all the teams listed, where the user can select teams to follow. The last will be an accounts page, where the user can edit their account and unsubscribe from teams. As of right now, we plan to use components for the banner, buttons, login/signup form, sports cards, and team cards.
