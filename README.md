# Dummy Title

## Introduction
We created a customizable sports newsletter for a house course at Duke. We allow users to sign up and choose NFL and NBA teams to follow. We call an API to get daily sports results, and we create email newsletters for each user based on their followed teams. Currently, we don't have access to a SMTP server, so no emails are sent.
