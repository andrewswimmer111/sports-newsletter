# Project Proposal

## Project Description
The project aims to simplify the process of obtaining sports news from your favorite sports teams. At the professional level, teams play incredibly often — for example baseball teams play 162 games in a year. It can often be hard to keep up with your favorite sports teams, especially if you follow multiple teams across multiple sports. This website will offer a solution to this problem.

We will use a database to store each user and their data, which includes their email address and the teams that they want to be notified about. Then, they’ll start receiving daily or weekly emails giving them updates about how their favorite team(s) have performed, with final scores and game stats. At any point, they can go into the website to update their preferences, and the corresponding preferences will be reflected in the next email. Our website’s user interface will let users navigate between different sports leagues and choose their favorite teams that they want to follow and then save those preferences, which will update the database. Users will also be able to login to our website and modify those settings or unsubscribe.

One major challenge is that we will need to find a free API that lets us access game data that gets updated daily in order to send these results to our users. We may also need a way to store the game result data that we get from those APIs in another database.
