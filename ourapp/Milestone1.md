# Milestone 1

## Goal 1
Our app should be able to fetch game results data every night that there is a game from an API in order to send to users. We will need some way to efficiently store and access this data. For example, we may store the data in a database, and then clear/update the database with new data that we get as games are played.

## Goal 2
Our app should be personalized for each user. They should be able to login with their email address and then access/update/delete their personal preferences - the teams that they are interested in following and being updated on. This information should be stored in a database and should be able to be updated by the user.

## Goal 3
Our app should be able to send automated emails to our users based on their preferences. The emails should contain summaries of games that the users indicated they were interested in, and should be built automatically based on the game data that we fetch.
