# Milestone 3

## Basic Functionality
The frontend & backend of our app are starting to take shape. We have successfully implemented user sign-in and sign-up, user authentication, and sessions. In addition, the following CRUD actions are now functional: 
* Updating user info (name, changing email, password)
* Deleting user accounts/unsubscribing from receiving our emails
* Users can choose which NFL & NBA teams to follow & have those settings saved to their account
* Users can update their preferences by unfollowing teams

## 7 Requirements:
* Our app is able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete records to our database
* Our app supports user login and signup
* Our app uses React's state management 

## TODO:
* Use open source API to fetch game data & build emails
* Finish setting up the automated email newsletter to send emails to users
