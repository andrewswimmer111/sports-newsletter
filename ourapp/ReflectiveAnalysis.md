##Reflective analysis

#Learning experience
While we both have experience in full stack web development, we still learned a lot this semester. Although we both had some exposure to the technologies used during our project, this was the most work we’ve done in both React and Rails, and it was our first time writing services in Ruby to use in an application. The lesson on gems was also very helpful: we learned how to evaluate gems based on their license and maintenance. 

However, the knowledge we gained in this class was not limited to technical knowledge. We also learned about all the resources that the colab has to offer. Before this class, we didn’t even know what the TEC was, but now, we know that there are lots of resources for anyone interested in building their personal projects, including online tutorials and in person office hours. 

Finally, we both learned the power of AI in full stack development. While we had both used AI previously in our academic careers, we had never really used AI to directly create the code for us. It was really cool to see how much AI could do, in particular GitHub Copilot, and how much time it could save writing functions or debugging small issues. However, it was also important to recognize the quality of the code it wrote; for example, the CSS that was AI generated contains many unnecessary lines that would sometimes cause bugs if we wanted to override it. 

#Teamwork experience
I believe our team worked together well. Because we knew each other beforehand, it was easy to trust the other person to accomplish their part when it was their turn to work, and it provided motivation for us when it was our turn to work. We did not run into any teamwork issues, and we generally agreed on most matters. 

I believe the size of the group also played a factor into this enjoyable experience. Because there were only two of us, coordinating the division of work or meeting times was not difficult. 

When deciding who would do what work, it mainly came down to what work needed to be done that week and how busy each of us were. We were both experienced in frontend and backend, so there was no clear division of labor that way. In the end, we believe this method worked out fairly well. 

#Alignment with Initial Proposal
We believe that our project more or less aligns with our initial proposal. I think in the process of development, we narrowed down our focus to what could be accomplished based on external factors such as time and the APIs available. By the end, our application only focuses on NFL and NBA teams. Also, we accomplished the task of sending emails, but it only works locally and the emails aren’t formatted super prettily. So in other words, we have accomplished all the core actions in our initial proposal but all these actions can be improved upon and developed further. 

#Future Projects (Where exceeded expectations and where failed)
We had high expectations going in, and overall we think that we did a good job achieving our goals, though nothing  in particular exceeded our expectations. One thing we wish we could have figured out is getting the emails to send on the VM.

Going forwards, we think that an important lesson is to start early and not procrastinate, in case we run out of time to finish everything. Another important lesson to carry forward is to seek help when we need it, especially now when we have resources that can help us.
